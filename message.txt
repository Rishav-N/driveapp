sql database username and password deleted from code. 

This app is a mock drive share app for users to create and join rides. 
The premise of this project was to learn more about java and how it interacts with sql database, html, css, javascript, and more.
I used this project for learning purposes only, learning about creating my own sockets, sessions, and more.
